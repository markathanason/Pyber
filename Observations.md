#Observations for Pyber dataset

*The apparent correlation of there being higher average fares the less populated the city is can potentially be attributed to longer rides for those, especially in rural areas, to reach their destination. This assertion cannot be confirmed without distance or time logs of individual fares, however, can be supported by the contrary evidence that urban rides result in relatively smaller average fares, assuming there are more frequent rides with shorter distances.

*In general, the number of drivers is highest in urban areas and lowest in rural areas, although some rural cities match the number of drivers in suburban and even urban cities. This trend can further be assessed if ride duration data was available which will allow us to infer what the fares are using the ride service for. In the city it may be for quick convienet trips to skip other public transit methods, however in more rural areas those fares may rely on the service more heavily for routine errands or even getting to work. 

*There appears to be an over-saturation of drivers in urban cities. Although 81% of the drivers are in urban centers, only 63% of the fares are made there while making up 68% of the total rides. This suggests there are more drivers than there are fares.
